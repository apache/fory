/**
 * Abstract base class for field converters that handle type conversions during
 * serialization/deserialization.
 *
 * <p>Field converters are responsible for converting values from one type to another when setting
 * field values. This is particularly useful when dealing with cross-language serialization where
 * type mappings may differ between languages, or when handling legacy data with different type
 * representations.
 *
 * <p>Each converter is associated with a specific field through a {@link FieldAccessor}, which
 * provides the mechanism to actually set the converted value on the target object.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Create a converter for an int field
 * FieldConverter<Integer> converter = new IntConverter(fieldAccessor);
 *
 * // Convert a string "123" to integer and set it on the target object
 * converter.set(targetObject, "123");
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <TO> the target type that this converter produces
 * @see FieldConverters for factory methods to create specific converter instances
 * @see FieldAccessor for the field access mechanism
