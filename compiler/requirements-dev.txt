# NOT part of the published fory-compiler package on PyPI.
# This file intentionally kept separate from pyproject.toml.
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   pip install -r compiler/requirements-dev.txt
#   pip install ./compiler
#   cd compiler && pyinstaller foryc.spec
#
# UPX must be installed separately as a system binary:
