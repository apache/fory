# AGENTS.md

This file provides comprehensive guidance to AI coding agents when working with the Apache Fory codebase.

## Core Principles

While working on Fory, please remember:

- **Performance First**: Performance is the top priority. Never introduce code that reduces performance without explicit justification.
- **English Only**: Always use English in code, comments, and documentation.
- **Meaningful Comments**: Only add comments when the code's behavior is difficult to understand or when documenting complex algorithms.
- **Focused Testing**: Only add tests that verify internal behaviors or fix specific bugs; don't create unnecessary tests unless requested.
- **Git-Tracked Files**: When reading code, skip all files not tracked by git by default unless generated by yourself.
- **Cross-Language Consistency**: Maintain consistency across language implementations while respecting language-specific idioms.

## Build and Development Commands

### Java Development

- All maven commands must be executed within the `java` directory.
- All changes to `java` must pass the code style check and tests.
- Fory java needs JDK `17+` installed.

```bash
# Clean the build
mvn -T16 clean

# Build
mvn -T16 package

# Install
mvn -T16 install -DskipTests

# Code format check
mvn -T16 spotless:check

# Code format
mvn -T16 spotless:apply

# Code style check
mvn -T16 checkstyle:check

# Run tests
mvn -T16 test

# Run specific tests
mvn -T16 test -Dtest=org.apache.fory.TestClass#testMethod
```

### C++ Development

- All commands must be executed within the `cpp` directory.

```bash
# Prepare for build
pip install pyarrow==15.0.0

# Build C++ library
bazel build //...

# Run tests
bazel test $(bazel query //...)

# Run specific test
bazel test //fory/util:buffer_test
```

### Python Development

- All commands must be executed within the `python` directory.
- All changes to `python` must pass the code style check and tests.
- When running tests, you can use the `ENABLE_FORY_CYTHON_SERIALIZATION` environment variable to enable or disable cython serialization.
- When debugging protocol related issues, you should use `ENABLE_FORY_CYTHON_SERIALIZATION=0` first to verify the behavior.
- Fory python needs cpython `3.8+` installed although some modules such as `fory-core` use `java8`.

```bash
# clean build
rm -rf build dist .pytest_cache
bazel clean --expunge

# Code format
ruff format .
ruff check --fix .

# Install
pip install -v -e .

# Build native extension
bazel build //:cp_fory_so --config=x86_64 # For x86_64
bazel build //:cp_fory_so --copt=-fsigned-char # For arm64 and aarch64

# Run tests without cython
ENABLE_FORY_CYTHON_SERIALIZATION=0 pytest -v -s .
# Run tests with cython
ENABLE_FORY_CYTHON_SERIALIZATION=1 pytest -v -s .
```

### Golang Development

- All commands must be executed within the `go/fory` directory.
- All changes to `go` must pass the format check and tests.
- Go implementation focuses on reflection-based and codegen-based serialization.

```bash
# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Run tests
go test -v

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race -v

# Build
go build

# Run linter (if golangci-lint is installed)
golangci-lint run

# Generate code (if using go:generate)
go generate ./...
```

### Rust Development

- All cargo commands must be executed within the `rust` directory.
- All changes to `rust` must pass the clippy check and tests.

```bash
# Check code
cargo check

# Build
cargo build

# Run linter for all services.
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Run tests (requires test features)
cargo test --features tests

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --check

# Build documentation
cargo doc --lib --no-deps --all-features

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Development

- All commands must be executed within the `javascript` directory.
- Uses npm/yarn for package management.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
node ./node_modules/.bin/jest --ci --reporters=default --reporters=jest-junit

# Format code
git ls-files -- '*.ts' | xargs -P 5 node ./node_modules/.bin/eslint
```

### Dart Development

- Uses pub for package management.

```bash
# First, generate necessary code
dart run build_runner build

# Run all tests
dart test

# Format code
dart analyze
dart fix --dry-run
dart fix --apply
```

### Kotlin Development

- All maven commands must be executed within the `kotlin` directory.
- Kotlin implementation provides extra serializers for kotlin types.
- Kotlin implementation is built on fory java, please install the java libraries first by `cd ../java && mvn -T16 install -DskipTests`. If no code changes after installed fory java, you can skip the installation step.

```bash
# Build
mvn clean package

# Run tests
mvn test
```

### Scala Development

- All commands must be executed within the `scala` directory.
- Scala implementation provides extra serializers for Scala types.
- Scala implementation is built on fory java, please install the java libraries first by `cd ../java && mvn -T16 install -DskipTests`. If no code changes after installed fory java, you can skip the installation step.

```bash
# Build with sbt
sbt compile

# Run tests
sbt test

# Format code
sbt scalafmt
```

### Integration Tests

- All commands must be executed within the `integration_tests` directory.
- For java related integration tests, please install the java libraries first by `cd ../java && mvn -T16 install -DskipTests`. If no code changes after installed fory java, you can skip the installation step.

## Architecture Overview

Apache Fory is a blazingly-fast multi-language serialization framework that revolutionizes data exchange between systems and languages. By leveraging JIT compilation, code generation and zero-copy techniques, Fory delivers up to 170x faster performance compared to other serialization frameworks while being extremely easy to use.

### Binary Protocols

Fory uses binary protocols for efficient serialization and deserialization. Fory designed and implemented multiple binary protocols for different scenarios:

- **[xlang serialization format](docs/specification/xlang_serialization_spec.md)**:
  - Cross-language serialize any object automatically, no need for IDL definition, schema compilation and object to/from protocol conversion.
  - Support optional shared reference and circular reference, no duplicate data or recursion error.
  - Support object polymorphism.
- **[Row format](docs/specification/row_format_spec.md)**: A cache-friendly binary random access format, supports skipping serialization and partial serialization, and can convert to column-format automatically.
- **[Java serialization format](docs/specification/java_serialization_spec.md)**: Highly-optimized and drop-in replacement for Java serialization.
- **Python serialization format**: Highly-optimized and drop-in replacement for Python pickle, which is an extension built upon **[xlang serialization format](docs/specification/xlang_serialization_spec.md)**.

**`docs/specification` are the specification for the Fory protocol**, please read those documents carefully and think hard and make sure you understand them before making changes to code and documentation.

### Core Structure

Fory serialization for every language is implemented independently to minimize the object memory layout interoperability, object allocation, memory access cost, thus maximize the performance. There is no code reuse between languages except for `fory python`, which reused code from `fory c++`.

#### Python

Fory python has two implementations for the protocol:

- **Cython mode**: Cython based implementation based on `xlang serialization format`, which is used by default and has better performance than pure python. This mode can be enabled by setting `ENABLE_FORY_CYTHON_SERIALIZATION=1` environment variable.
- **Python mode** and **Cython mode** reused some code from each other to reduce code duplication.

Code structure:

- `python/pyfory/_serialization.pyx`: Core serialization logic and entry point for cython mode based on `xlang serialization format`
- `python/pyfory/_fory.py`: Serialization entry point for pure python mode based on `xlang serialization format`

- **Version Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility when possible

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on internal behavior verification
- **Integration Tests**: Use `integration_tests/` for cross-language compatibility
