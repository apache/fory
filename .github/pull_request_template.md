## AI Contribution Checklist (required when AI assistance = `yes`)

<!-- Please read: https://github.com/apache/fory/blob/main/AI_CONTRIBUTION_POLICY.md -->
<!-- Mark `yes` when AI materially influenced technical content.
Examples: non-trivial code/test logic generated by AI (even one function), about 20+ added/changed lines influenced by AI, or AI influence on API/protocol/performance/architecture decisions.
Mark `no` for minor/narrow assistance only (spelling/grammar/formatting/trivial comment or wording edits with no behavior impact). -->

- [ ] If `yes`, I included the standardized AI Usage Disclosure block below.
- [ ] If `yes`, I can explain and defend all important changes without AI help.
- [ ] If `yes`, I reviewed AI-assisted code changes line by line before submission.
- [ ] If `yes`, I ran adequate human verification and recorded evidence (checks run locally or in CI, pass/fail summary, and confirmation I reviewed results).
- [ ] If `yes`, I added/updated tests and specs where required.
- [ ] If `yes`, I validated protocol/performance impacts with evidence when applicable.
- [ ] If `yes`, I verified licensing and provenance compliance.
